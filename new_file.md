# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is a web-based Coin Decider where users can register, log in, and play a coin flip game to earn or lose credits. The application is built using a combination of TypeScript, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, with a backend powered by Express.js and a PostgreSQL database managed through Drizzle ORM.

## Website Functionality

1. **User Registration and Login**: Users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password. They can then log in to access the game and their profile.

2. **Profile Management**: Users can view and edit their profile information, including their username and email.

3. **Coin Decider**: Users can participate in a coin flip game where they choose heads or tails. If they win, their balance doubles; if they lose, their balance is reset to zero.

4. **Credit Machine**: Users can earn credits by interacting with a credit machine feature on the website.

5. **Balance Management**: Users can view their current balance and it gets updated based on their game results and interactions with the credit machine.

## Website Workflow

1. **User Registration**: Users sign up by providing their details, which are validated and stored in the database.

2. **Login**: Users log in using their credentials, receiving a JWT token for authentication.

3. **Profile Access**: Users can view and edit their profile information, which is fetched and updated through secure API calls.

4. **Playing the Game**: Users select heads or tails and initiate a coin flip. The result is determined server-side, and the user's balance is updated accordingly.

5. **Earning Credits**: Users can interact with the credit machine to earn additional credits, which are updated in real-time.

6. **Balance Management**: Users can view their current balance at any time, with updates reflecting their game results and credit earnings.
